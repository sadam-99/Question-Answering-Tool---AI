## Implementation of Question Answering Tool


## KnowledgeBaseFOL


## Files Description:
```KnowledgeBaseFOL&PlainEnglish.txt``` : This file contains the Kowledge base in English and First Order Logic (FOL) Form
```KnowledgeBaseFOL.txt``` : This file contains the Kowledge base in First Order Logic (FOL) Form which is used as assumptions.
```InputProver9.txt``` : This file is the input file which could be imported into prover9 as Assumptions.
```CS6364-AI-Project-SXG190040.pdf``` : This file contains the report of my Question Answering tool.


## Running the Question Answering Tool using Prover 9:
Open Prover 9 -> Go to File -> open input File -> open ```InputProver9.txt``` file. You will see all the FOLs in the assumptions section.
Enter your goal/Question in Goal section. Click on start button on right in Prover 9 to run the tool.
You will see another window in which you will see the Proof of the Query in the Goal




## Results
The Results/Proofs Can be seen on a new window in which you will see the Proof of the Query in the Goal when you run on Prover9:
```Questions_Outputs_Proofs``` Folder contains the Images of the Outputs of Every Question from Prover9



# Note:  You can add any other FOLs in the assumptions and Test your own Questions !


### Conclusion :
This project has helped me in building the question answering tool based on a given specific context and how Knowledge Base is constructed in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This project also helped me in constructing the first order logic form for Knowledge base in any system.  The performance of Prover 9 tool came out to be quite decent as I tested on many different questions, it gave me relevant answers. This project could be expanded to a bigger context(1000’s of Pages) and this tool could be tested on varied data questions in order to check how indirect questions are being answered through this tool.
